  <h2>How to play</h2>
  <p>Click on a square(s) to active that square. Set the number of generations you want to iterate through and the user will be displayed with the final state of active and inactive boxes after those generations have been iterated through. Click the start button to start the Game of Life Simulation.Note this simulation will be fast</p>

    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <p>Each of the square boxed has one of two possible states, alive or dead, (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors, which are the boxes that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Any live boxes with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.</li>
      <li>Any live boxes with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.</li>
      <li>Any live box with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
      <li>Any dead box with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live box, as if by reproduction.</li>
    </ol>
